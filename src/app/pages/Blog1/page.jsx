            We have arrived in Turkey! Following two delightful weeks in the
            Netherlands, where we could have happily extended our stay by
            another week, we are now on the move again after spending four
            months traveling through Africa. Our backpacks are exceptionally
            heavy this time as they contain party clothes for a wedding and warm
            attire for our upcoming trek in Nepal&apos;s Annapurna region. But
            first, we explore Istanbul!

              After a long travel day, marked by disruptions due to strikes by
              Dutch farmers and issues with the Dutch railway system, we finally
              arrive, exhausted, at Sabiha Airport in Istanbul. An hour later,
              we check into Jumba Hostel, a charming and quirky place located in
              the bustling Taksim district. Surrounded by trendy restaurants, we
              soon find ourselves sitting in one with our friends Willemijn and
              Jiri. Willemijn, a friend from Maastricht, travels the world
              full-time as a digital nomad with Jiri. By chance, they were in
              Istanbul at the same time as us, and after nearly two years apart,
              we quickly arranged to meet for drinks. It turned out to be a
              delightful evening with plenty to catch up on.

            Walking through the streets of Istanbul, you quickly find yourself
            immersed in a vibrant blend of cultures. The cobblestones beneath
            your feet carry the history of ancient empires, while the air is
            filled with the inviting scents of street food and the melodic calls
            to prayer. Every corner you turn reveals something new, from the
            bustling alleys of the Grand Bazaar with its array of colors and
            aromas to the serene courtyards of the Hagia Sophia adorned with
            beautiful mosaics. Exploring neighborhoods like the artistic Karak√∂y
            and the historic Sultanahmet, you get a true sense of the
            city&apos;s rich heritage. A stroll along the Bosphorus offers
            stunning views of the water and the city&apos;s illuminated skyline,
            making every moment in Istanbul a captivating experience.

              Visiting the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia in Istanbul is an
              awe-inspiring experience that encapsulates the city rich history
              and architectural grandeur. The Blue Mosque, with its cascading
              domes and six minarets, stands as a testament to Ottoman
              craftsmanship, its interior adorned with over 20,000 hand-painted
              blue tiles that create a serene and ethereal atmosphere. Just a
              short walk away, the Hagia Sophia boasts a remarkable history,
              having served as both a cathedral and a mosque. Its massive dome,
              supported by intricate Byzantine architecture, seems to float
              above the spacious nave, casting a sense of wonder on all who
              enter. The mosaics, some shimmering with gold, narrate centuries
              of religious and cultural transitions. Outside, the courtyards and
              gardens provide a tranquil retreat from the bustling city. As you
              stand between these two monumental structures, you feel a profound
              connection to the past, where empires rose and fell, and different
              faiths found expression under these majestic roofs. The experience
              is both humbling and uplifting, leaving you with a deep
              appreciation for Istanbul&apos;s unique place at the crossroads of
              history and culture.

              Topkapi Palace in Istanbul is a majestic symbol of Ottoman
              grandeur and history. Located in the heart of the city, it served
              as the main residence and administrative headquarters of the
              Ottoman sultans for nearly 400 years. The palace complex, which
              includes lavish courtyards, ornate rooms, and beautiful gardens,
              is a reflection of the empire&apos;s wealth and sophistication.
              Visitors can explore the Imperial Harem, where the sultan&apos;s
              family lived, and view the stunning collection of imperial
              treasures, including jewel-encrusted weapons, delicate porcelain,
              and the famous Topkapi Dagger. The palace also houses religious
              relics, such as the Prophet Muhammad&apos;s cloak and sword,
              adding to its historical and cultural significance. The views from
              the palace grounds are breathtaking, offering panoramic vistas of
              the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn. A visit to Topkapi Palace is a
              journey through the opulence and power of the Ottoman Empire, and
              it provides a deep insight into the rich history and heritage of
              Istanbul.
